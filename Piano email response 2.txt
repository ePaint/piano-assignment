Our team has received a ticket from an individual who is having trouble setting up his digital access account.
When he tries to log in, he gets the message “You have successfully logged in”
But then when he opens an article he gets the message asking him to purchase a subscription.

Here is his contact information: Ryan Kanp - Enduser@anenduser.com

The Piano dashboard confirms his account, but there are no payment details.
Can you please look into Mr. Kanp’s account and help us resolve this issue?
